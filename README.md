# ChEMBL_parsing_script
Scripts that enable researchers to parse through ChEMBL bioactivity reports in relation to a specific biological target and provides insight into some important for Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) features.
Cannabinoid Receptor Type 1 was used as an example in case of python script. I have also put an additional parser (script in R) which is 'lighter' version of proposed python parser (Histamine Receptor Type 3 was used as an example).


Dependencies:
1) Python script:
  a) pandas
  b) decimal
2) R script:
   a) dplyr
